### What is GoogleCloudReady Facilitator program?
The GoogleCloudReady Facilitator program will provide you an opportunity to kickstart your career in cloud and get hands on practice on Google Cloud - the tool that powers apps like Google Search, Gmail and YouTube.

Along the way, you will learn & practice concepts like computing, application development, big data & machine learning using cloud & if you get stuck, you will have your "Facilitators" who are specially trained on Google Cloud to help.

### Why should you participate in the program?
- You can showcase what you've learned here to your professional network **using Google Cloud-hosted quest & skill badges** that you can add to your resume and professional profiles like LinkedIn.
- And on top of these amazing badges, you get a chance to **win some really cool Google Cloud goodies**.
